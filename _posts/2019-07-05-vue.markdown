**My notes on starting with Vue**

___


I am actually working on a disqus alternative, something that is open source and is self hosted and is just
open and extensible in general, be it the design or the features.

I decided to go with Vue for this one, based on a few times I scratched the surface through one of those medium articles.
To kickstart that, I needed to know what I was getting into, so I sat down and went through the docs, and boy am I happy to choose Vue!

I skipped through the Vuex and Router part and will be looking into it later. But for someone coming from backend background, Vue feels natural.
The decisions it made and the way it structured itself, there seems to be a flow. 

Well, that wraps it up!
