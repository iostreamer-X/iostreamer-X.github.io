My laptop charger is dead
==
<br/>
That is how this story begins. 

My laptop has been dark for more than 24 hours, all because 
it is a piece of junk which has a battery backup of 15 mins and 
also because its charger broke. 

All that is left now is my phone, or so I thought.
I recently got my CHIP, which is a 8$ headless pc. Has 1Ghz 
processor, 512mb RAM, 4 gigs of space. But what I love the most
is its inbuilt WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. 

So, I decided to turn it into a permanent and always-on home
server.

And because I don't have my laptop running, it's customary to 
write a blog post from my phone through SSH. And that's what 
I did.


I cloned my blog repo from github, thought about installing ruby
and bundle to run a local server but decided I didn't need it.
Pretty normal stuff.

Next is getting pictures. Easiest way I saw was to start an 
HTTP server on my phone, and download the images through wget. 
And that's what I did.

Lastly, made a new file for this post, took the first few 
standard YAML lines from my previous post(`head -7 | file.md`).

And here I am, in nano, writing this post. It's fun because it's 
weird and a bit stupid. But hey, that's what I do, stupid stuff.
