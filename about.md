Greetings wanderer! I am a dev who loves/lives to code. Polyglot, yes. I love frameworks and languages.
I feel like a kid who got a new toy when I see new languages.I started with JAVA for Android.
Well actually my first language was C++ in school but I donâ€™t count that. And through my way in time I
fell for Scala, learned node.js, dabbled in machine learning, did a bit of parallel programming on my nvidia gpu,
fell for creative coding(processing), and became a linux fan. The **tldr** version is that I really enjoy building
new things and I also love good design.

Oh and that wolf thing on the cover isn't random. I am obsessed with the witcher series.

Va fail, dh'oine!
