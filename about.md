For a long time, I had considered starting a personal blog. One day, while talking with a friend who had recently been laid off, she stated how she had so much time to focus on things she wants in life, such as creating a blog, but she doesn't. <span style="color: #CCCCCC">That's when I realised that doing things you enjoy isn't an issue of not having enough time; rather, it's a matter of prioritising what you value more</span>. I bought this domain with no plan in mind the very same day, spent the following three days imagining how my home page should appear, and I kid you not, I had so much fun designing it. As I sat with myself, the homepage shouting at me, "What should I write about?", I realised how incomplete a personal website without a about me page would appear. As a result, I'm dedicating this first page to myself.

My first thoughts with starting this were, "How personal should I make it?" Unless you're a really close buddy, I've always been a reserved person. I have critical ideas about nearly everything, but I keep them to myself. It is most likely due to a fear of being judged. <span style="color: #CCCCCC">(By the way, this is something I do a lot. I like to associate behaviours to deeper underlying root causes, and you'd be surprised how much of our patterns are influenced by our upbringing.)</span> When I discovered the fundamental problem and stopped caring what others thought, it became increasingly easy for me to express my views. This blog site is a continuation of the same principle.

I've always been a hard worker. It's one of those things I was born with, and I'm grateful I was programmed that way. When you combine this trait with unyielding consistency and discipline, you have a ticking time bomb: i.e., learning / achieving anything for me is simply a matter of giving it enough time and never a question of capability. <span style="color: #CCCCCC"> (I realise it's a humble brag, but it's pride month, and the lesson I learned this year is to be UNAPOLOGETICALLY YOURSELF) </span>. As a result I've always had outstanding grades, earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from IIT Delhi, and continue to do well at work. I was massively overweight as a child and for the majority of my undergraduate years, but once I started working out a couple years back, I've managed to keep my body fat between 14% - 18% and have a few abs to show for it.

I want to use my talents to achieve so much more in life. I've been learning to play the piano in the hopes of performing ten years from now. I want to start my own business that has an impact. Be decent in at least one sport. I really like basketball. I enjoy playing video games on my Playstation 5 and watching films, particularly psychological thrillers.
